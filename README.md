Designed and implemented a production-style Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture, built entirely with Microsoft SQL Server and T-SQL.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering skills — from raw ingestion to analytics-ready dimensional modeling — using only SQL.

🧱 Architecture

Bronze Layer – Raw data storage (staging tables)
Silver Layer – Data cleansing, transformation, validation
Gold Layer – Star schema with fact & dimension tables optimized for reporting

All transformations implemented using:

Stored Procedures
Views
Indexing strategies
Constraints & data integrity rules

🚀 What This Project Showcases

Strong SQL & T-SQL proficiency
Data warehouse architecture design
Dimensional modeling (Star Schema)
Performance optimization techniques
Structured, production-ready database organization
Clean separation between staging, transformation, and analytics layers

🎯 Why This Matters

This project reflects my ability to design scalable, structured data systems — not just write queries, but architect complete data solutions using SQL.
